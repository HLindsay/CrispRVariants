Description: CrispRVariants provides tools for analysing the results of a CRISPR-Cas9
          mutagenesis sequencing experiment, or other sequencing experiments where variants
          within a given region are of interest.  These tools allow users to localize variant
          allele combinations with respect to any genomic location (e.g. the Cas9 cut site),
          plot allele combinations and calculate mutation rates with flexible filtering of
          unrelated variants.
